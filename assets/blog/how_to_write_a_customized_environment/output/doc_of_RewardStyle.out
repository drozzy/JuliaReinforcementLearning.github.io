Specify whether we can get reward after each step or only at the end of an game. Possible values are [`STEP_REWARD`](@ref) (the default one) or [`TERMINAL_REWARD`](@ref).

!!! note
    Environments of [`TERMINAL_REWARD`](@ref) style can be viewed as a subset of environments of [`STEP_REWARD`](@ref) style. For some algorithms, like MCTS, we may have some a more efficient implementation for environments of [`TERMINAL_REWARD`](@ref) style.
