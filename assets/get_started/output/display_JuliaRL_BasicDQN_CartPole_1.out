    This experiment uses three dense layers to approximate the Q value.
The testing environment is CartPoleEnv.


    Agent and statistic info will be saved to: `/home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_2020_11_09_02_57_18`
    You can also view the tensorboard logs with
    `tensorboard --logdir /home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_2020_11_09_02_57_18/tb_log`
    To load the agent and statistic info:
    ```
    agent = RLCore.load("/home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_2020_11_09_02_57_18", Agent)
    BSON.@load joinpath("/home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_2020_11_09_02_57_18", "stats.bson") total_reward_per_episode time_per_step
    ```
